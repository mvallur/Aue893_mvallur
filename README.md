The files added are and these should be run:
turtlebot_grid_cleaner.py (This is implemented in Gazebo)
turtlebot_real_back_and_forth.py (This runs on the turtlebot as well as in Gazebo) 	
turtlesim_grid_cleaner.py 	(This works in the turtle simulator and moves in order to clean 10x10room)
turtlesim_spiral_cleaner.py (This works in the turtle simulator and moves in a spiral orientaion to clean 10x10room)
The aim of assignment was to move the turtle bot for "coverage" of a room (nominally 10' x 10') within a teleoperation framework.
This was achieved and the files have been compiled and executed.
